# Skill Architect (Autonomous Growth)

## Goal
Enable the agent to identify and draft new skills to improve project efficiency.

## Directives
1. If the User gives the same architectural correction twice, propose a new Skill in `.agent/skills/staging/`.
2. Skills must be atomic and follow the standard skill format.
3. You cannot activate a skill (move it out of staging) without explicit approval.
